# Simple Battery Manager
A low cost simple battery manager breakout board. You can use it with any MCU for battery monitoring! 

This board is designed for efficiently monitoring battery voltage without causing any significant current drain on the battery itself. Also have the feature of auto-switch between VBAT and a 5V input, so you don't need to unplug the battery when conecting a USB power supply for example.

You can change the voltage divider (R2 and R3) to match your voltages and measurement needs.

JP1 is for current measurement.
